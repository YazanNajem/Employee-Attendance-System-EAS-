# Employee Attendance System (EAS)
Employee Attendance System (EAS) | Including admin side UI (FULL ACCESS), Manager side UI and Employee side UI, with user authentication login/ registration for better security. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django as a framework.

## ‚ùî What is EAS?
A way of managing employees' attendance to reduce the loss due to employee absence. A positive attendance system strategy depends on incentives, effective employee engagement, and transparent communication. The attendance system specifies when employees must attend to work, especially with hourly or nonexempt employees. This system is crucial for nonexempt employees, who perform jobs that require a person to be there to serve customers. However, without the attendance system, recording this information was a full of mistakes. The usual attendance method was to record the data on Excel sheets or physical attendance registers (Paper). These old methods lead to plenty of human errors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS?
